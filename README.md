## Description

AssegaiPHP is a complete server-side web framework that enables you to create clean, powerful and efficient [PHP] applications in a fraction of the time by utilizing the latest features of the language.

We believe in the power of simplicity and efficiency. That's why we've designed our framework to be as intuitive and straightforward as possible, taking inspiration from successful frameworks like [NestJS] and [Angular].

Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and modern toolkit for PHP developers, one that allows them to get their applications up and running as quickly and easily as possible. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, we believe that AssegaiPHP has something to offer you.

Our framework is built on the philosophy of loosely coupled, easily maintainable code. We believe that by following this approach, developers can create applications that are more scalable and easier to test.

But AssegaiPHP isn't just about code â€“ it's about community too. We believe in the power of open-source development, and we're dedicated to building a thriving community of developers who share our passion for creating high-quality applications.
